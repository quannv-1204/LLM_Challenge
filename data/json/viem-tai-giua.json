Acute otitis media Often a complication of the function of the ear canal that occurs during a viral upper respiratory infection.(4) 2. Chronic otitis media is a persistent inflammation of the middle ear that drains pus for a long time through the eardrum perforation (usually over 12 weeks). 3. Fluid-filled otitis media is a condition in which the mucosa of the middle ear becomes inflamed and secretes fluid, but this fluid does not drain out of the ear but remains behind the eardrum. Fluid-filled fluid can be in the form of serum, mucus, or adhesive glue.",

The ear nozzle is responsible for regulating air pressure and refreshing the air in the ear, while draining normal secretions from the middle ear. When the ear nozzle is swollen it can clog it, causing fluid to build up in the middle ear causing infection. In children, the undeveloped ear nozzles are often narrower and more horizontal, making drainage difficult leading to an infection of the middle ear.

But repeated ear infections, or severe ear infections that develop pus in the middle ear, can lead to severe hearing loss, damage to the eardrum, and permanent hearing loss. Slow speech or development: If infants and toddlers have temporary or permanent hearing loss, it can cause delayed speech, social interaction, and development. Atrial perforation: Most perforations heal within 72 hours, but surgical intervention is often needed. Encephalitis or meningitis: If the infection is left untreated or does not respond well to treatment, it can spread to adjacent tissues causing a mastoid infection called mastoiditis. mastoiditis can lead to bone damage and the formation of pus-filled cysts.

            "normalized_content": "In the course of professional treatment, we often receive people's questions about otitis media. Please answer each specific question as follows: 1. Is otitis media dangerous? Otitis media is an inflammatory disease that, if left untreated, can lead to chronic otitis. This condition is harder to treat and the disease often recurs. The next serious complication is hearing loss or deafness. This condition causes children to slow down their speech and development, causes adults to lose confidence and difficulty in communication. Complications of encephalitis, or meningitis are dangerous, can threaten the life of the person. 2. Is otitis media contagious? Otitis media can be transmitted through the nose and throat, due to rhinotracheitis otitis media complications. Otitis media in Vietnam is very common and easily becomes an epidemic in preschools and primary schools. Therefore, people should pay attention to prevention, especially for children of preschool age. Parents should note that hearing loss complications caused by otitis media slow down cognition and development will cause serious consequences, lifelong effects on the future and health of children. Children are also at risk of death if complications of encephalitis and meningitis occur. – Dr Hang recommends. 3. Why are children more likely to have ear infections than adults? Children are more likely to have ear infections than adults for the following reasons: Eustachian tubes in young children are usually short and horizontal, creating favorable conditions for fluid to accumulate behind the eardrum. Children's immune system, especially the body's anti-infection system is still not fully developed. VA in children is older than adults, so it is easier to develop infections.
