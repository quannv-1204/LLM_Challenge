When introduced into the body, under the influence of many enzymes, hormones, receptors, transport proteins and cofactors, they will be converted into energy to provide daily living activities. (1) Congenital metabolic disorder is a rare genetic disease in children, caused by deficiencies of receptors, enzymes, transport proteins, or cofactors in metabolism of amino acids, fatty acids and organic acids. This leads to abnormal changes in the synthesis or degradation cycles of substances in the body. This creates abnormal products that poison cells, impair organ function, and even cause death for children. During pregnancy, the fetus absorbs nutrients metabolized from the mother. But after birth, the baby provides its own nutrients by breastfeeding, at which point the baby's digestive system begins to function. However, the substances are not fully metabolized and symptoms of metabolic disorders begin to appear. Therefore, early detection of congenital metabolic disorders is extremely important. Parents need to pay attention to their baby's unusual signs and need to take their baby to medical facilities for examination and treatment as soon as there are signs or suspicions that the child has an inborn metabolic disorder.",

            "normalized_content": "1. Amino acid metabolism disorder in infants Amino acid metabolism disorder is a condition in which mutated genes make enzymes unable to synthesize, decompose or absorb amino acids from protein foods such as meat, fish, eggs, milk, etc. This leads to the accumulation of unmetabolized proteins and the formation of abnormal metabolites in cells and organs, causing disease in children. 2. Fatty acid metabolism disorder in newborns Fatty acid metabolism disorder in newborns is a congenital syndrome that affects the ability to decompose fat in newborns. Normally, the body will metabolize glucose from starch and sugar to create energy for life activities and when this energy source is depleted, the body will use stored energy from fat. However, when children have fatty acid metabolism disorder, they will not be able to use fat to produce energy. Therefore, the blood sugar levels of sick children are always low and the blood accumulates many toxic substances. 3. Organic acid metabolism disorder Organic acid metabolism disorder is a disorder that affects the ability to use amino acids (components to build proteins in the body) and the ability to synthesize and use ketones (organic compounds produced by the body during the process of burning fat to produce energy) in the body. When using vitamins, proteins and carbohydrates (sugars) in food, patients can develop serious symptoms, even death. Common organic acid metabolism disorders include: 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (3MCC) enzyme deficiency. Beta-ketothiolase (BKT) enzyme deficiency. Glutaric acidemia type I (Glutaric acidemia type 1 – GA1). Hydroxymethyl Glutaric aciduria (HMG) enzyme deficiency. Unable to decompose leucine causing Isovaleric Acid Abnormalities (IVA). Abnormalities in Methylmalonic acid metabolism (CBI A and CBI B). Multiple carboxylase enzyme deficiency (MCD). Propionic acid metabolism disorder (PROP). Among them, 3MCC and PROP are the two most common disorders, with an incidence of 1:75,000 children born each year. 4. Carbohydrate metabolism disorder: Galactosemia Carbohydrate metabolism disorder (Galactosemia) is a condition of excess galactose in the blood. Galactose is a component in lactose, often found in dairy products, especially in artificial milk powder for children. In addition, some other foods may also have small amounts of galactose. 5. Lysosome storage disorder: Pompe, MPS, Gaucher, Fabry Lysosome is an organelle containing hydrolytic enzymes that degrade proteins, complex carbohydrates, nucleic acids, lipids, sulfates and phosphates, forming products that can be reused or eliminated from the body. Lysosomal storage disorders are a group of diseases related to about 40 disorders of genes encoding enzymes in lysosomes. The absence or loss of function of an enzyme, after a period of time, will cause accumulation of intermediate metabolic products, leading to destruction of cell structure and function. A large number of cells die causing loss of organ function in the body. Among them, common Lysosome disorders include: Pompe disease: has an incidence of 1:40,000. MPS disease: includes MPS-I (1:100,000), MPS-II (1:136,000), MPS-IVA (1:250,000), MPS-VI (1:300,000). Gaucher disease: has an incidence of 1:57,000. Fabry disease: has an incidence of 1:40,000.",
